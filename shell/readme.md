To create a shell script that kills processes owned by other users, you need to identify processes running under different user IDs (UIDs) and then terminate them. Here's a simple script that uses the `ps`, `grep`, and `kill` commands to achieve this.

### Steps:
1. **Get a list of processes**: We'll list all processes running on the system using `ps`.
2. **Identify processes owned by other users**: We'll check the user ID (UID) of each process.
3. **Kill the processes owned by other users**: If the process is not owned by the current user, we kill it using the `kill` command.

Hereâ€™s the shell script:

### `kill_other_users_processes.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the current user's username
CURRENT_USER=$(whoami)

# Get the list of all running processes and filter by the user (excluding the current user)
ps -eo pid,uid,user,comm --sort=uid | while read PID UID USER CMD; do
  # Skip the header line or processes owned by the current user
  if [[ "$USER" == "USER" || "$USER" == "$CURRENT_USER" ]]; then
    continue
  fi

  # Kill the process if it's owned by another user
  echo "Killing process PID: $PID, User: $USER, Command: $CMD"
  kill -9 "$PID"
done
```

### Explanation of the script:

1. **`ps -eo pid,uid,user,comm --sort=uid`**:  
   This command lists all processes with the following columns:
   - `pid`: Process ID.
   - `uid`: User ID.
   - `user`: Username of the user running the process.
   - `comm`: Command that started the process.
   The `--sort=uid` sorts the output by user ID.

2. **`while read PID UID USER CMD; do ... done`**:  
   This loop reads each line from the `ps` output. It splits the output into variables (`PID`, `UID`, `USER`, `CMD`).

3. **Skip header and current user's processes**:  
   The script checks if the process is owned by the current user or if it's a header line, and skips those processes.

4. **Kill the process**:  
   The script uses the `kill -9` command to terminate processes that are owned by users other than the current user.

### Notes:
- The script assumes the user running the script has the necessary privileges to kill processes owned by other users (root or via `sudo`).
- The script uses `kill -9`, which forcibly terminates processes. Be cautious, as this might cause data loss or other unintended effects.

### To make the script executable:
1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `kill_other_users_processes.sh`.
2. Run the following command to make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x kill_other_users_processes.sh
   ```

### To run the script:
Execute the script with superuser privileges (if required):
```bash
sudo ./kill_other_users_processes.sh
```

This will terminate all processes owned by users other than the current user running the script.
